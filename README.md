**Project Overview**
The Carbon Footprint India Analytics Tool is a web-based analytics dashboard that provides insights into carbon emissions across various regions in India. The tool utilizes data visualization and machine learning techniques to help policymakers, researchers, and individuals understand emission trends, identify high-emission zones, and suggest ways to reduce carbon footprints.

**Features**
Interactive Dashboards: Visual representations of carbon emissions using charts and graphs.

**Region-Wise Analytics**: Breakdown of emissions by state, city, and industry.

**Trend Analysis**: Historical data trends to track emissions over time.

**Prediction Models**: Machine learning-based forecasting of future carbon footprints.

Recommendations: AI-powered suggestions for reducing carbon emissions.
